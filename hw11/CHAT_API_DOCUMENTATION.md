An unexpected server error `500` or "hung" response *may* occur during any of these requests. It is likely to do with your request. Make sure that you have included the appropriate headers and, if you are doing a POST, that you have a properly formatted and stringified JSON body. If the error persists, please contact a member of the course staff.

Make sure to include credentials and specify a content-type where appropriate. A valid `X-CS571-ID` must be included with each request, otherwise you will recieve a `401` in addition to any of the errors described below.

## In-Depth Explanations

### Getting all Chatrooms
`GET` `https://cs571api.cs.wisc.edu/rest/s26/hw11/chat/chatrooms`

A `200` (new) or `304` (cached) response will be sent with the list of all chatrooms.

```json
[
    "Bascom Hill Hangout",
    "Memorial Union Meetups",
    "Witte Whispers",
    "Chadbourne Chats",
    "Red Gym Rendezvous",
    "Babcock Banter",
    "Humanities Hubbub"
]
```

### Getting Messages

`GET` `https://cs571api.cs.wisc.edu/rest/s26/hw11/chat/messages?chatroom=CHATROOM_NAME`

**All messages are public**, you do *not* need to be logged in to access them. The `chatroom` query parameter is optional; if specified, only the 10 most recent messages from that chatroom will be returned, otherwise the 10 most recent messages across all chatrooms will be returned. A `200` (new) or `304` (cached) response will be sent with messages organized from most recent to least recent. Note that the `created` field is in a ISO 8601 format.

```json
{
    "msg": "Successfully got the latest messages!",
    "messages": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "poster": "acct123",
            "title": "Where is everyone??",
            "content": "Is this assignment released yet?",
            "chatroom": "Bascom Hill Hangout",
            "created": "2023-10-14T21:06:15.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": 1,
            "poster": "acct123",
            "title": "Hello! 👋",
            "content": "Welcome to BadgerChat! 🦡",
            "chatroom": "Bascom Hill Hangout",
            "created": "2023-10-14T20:58:53.000Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

If a chatroom is specified that does not exist, a `404` will be returned.

```json
{
    "msg": "The specified chatroom does not exist. Chatroom names are case-sensitive."
}
```

### Registering a User
`POST` `https://cs571api.cs.wisc.edu/rest/s26/hw11/chat/register`

You must register a user with a specified `username` and 7-digit `pin`.

Requests must include credentials as well as a header `Content-Type: application/json`.

**Example Request Body**

```json
{
    "username": "test123456",
    "pin": "1234567"
}
```

If the registration is successful, the following `200` will be sent...
```json
{
    "msg": "Successfully authenticated.",
    "user": {
        "id": 1,
        "username": "test123456"
    },
    "eat": 1709410275
}
```

A `Set-Cookie` response header will include your JWT in `badgerchat_auth`. This is *not* accessible by JavaScript. The provided token is an irrevocable JWT that will be valid for **1 hour**. All future requests that include credentials will send this cookie with the request.

`eat` specifies the time (as seconds since epoch) when the provided `badgerchat_auth` will expire.

If you forget to include a `username` or `pin`, the following `400` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg": "A request must contain a 'username' and 'pin'"
}
```

If a `pin` is not exactly 7 digits, the following `400` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg":  "A pin must exactly be a 7-digit PIN code passed as a string."
}
```

If a user by the requested `username` already exists, the following `409` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg": "The user already exists!"
}
```

If the `username` is longer than 64 characters or if the `pin` is longer than 128 characters, the following `413` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg": "'username' must be 64 characters or fewer"
}
```

### Logging in to an Account

`POST` `https://cs571api.cs.wisc.edu/rest/s26/hw11/chat/login`

You must log a user in with their specified `username` and 7-digit `pin`.

Requests must include credentials as well as a header `Content-Type: application/json`.

**Example Request Body**

```json
{
    "username": "test123456",
    "pin": "1234567"
}
```

If the login is successful, the following `200` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg": "Successfully authenticated.",
    "user": {
        "id": 1,
        "username": "test123456"
    },
    "eat": 1709410275
}
```

A `Set-Cookie` response header will include your JWT in `badgerchat_auth`. This is *not* accessible by JavaScript. The provided token is an irrevocable JWT that will be valid for **1 hour**. All future requests that include credentials will send this cookie with the request.

`eat` specifies the time (as seconds since epoch) when the provided `badgerchat_auth` will expire.

If you forget the `username` or `pin`, the following `400` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg": "A request must contain a 'username' and 'pin'"
}
```

If the `username` or `pin` is incorrect, the following `401` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg": "That username or pin is incorrect!"
}
```

### Posting a Message

`POST` `https://cs571api.cs.wisc.edu/rest/s26/hw11/chat/messages?chatroom=CHATROOM_NAME`

Posting a message is a protected operation; you must have a valid `badgerchat_auth` session. The `CHATROOM_NAME` must be specified as a query parameter in the URL, and a `title` and `content` in its request body.

Requests must include credentials as well as a header `Content-Type: application/json`.

**Example Request Body**

```json
{
    "title": "My Test Post",
    "content": "lorem ipsum dolor sit"
}
```

If the post is successful, the following `200` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg": "Successfully posted message!",
    "id": 37
}
```

If you forget the `title` or `content`, the following `400` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg": "A request must contain a 'title' and 'content'"
}
```

If authentication fails (such as an expired token), the following `401` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg": "You must be logged in to do that!"
}
```

If a chatroom is specified that does not exist, a `404` will be returned.

```json
{
    "msg": "The specified chatroom does not exist. Chatroom names are case-sensitive."
}
```

If the `title` is longer than 128 characters or if the `content` is longer than 1024 characters, the following `413` will be sent...
```json
{
    "msg": "'title' must be 128 characters or fewer and 'content' must be 1024 characters or fewer"
}
```

### Logging out
`POST` `https://cs571api.cs.wisc.edu/rest/s26/hw11/chat/logout`

Logging out will cause the server to respond with a `Set-Cookie` header that will overwrite and delete the `badgerchat_auth`. 

Requests must include credentials. There is no request body for this request.

The following `200` will be sent...

```json
{
    "msg": "You have been logged out! Goodbye."
}
```

### Who Am I?
`GET` `https://cs571api.cs.wisc.edu/rest/s26/hw11/chat/whoami`

This endpoint will check if a user is logged in and who they claim to be, including when their token was issued and when it will expire in Unix epoch time.

This request must include credentials. There is no request body for this request.

If the user is logged in, the following `200` will be sent...

```json
{
    "isLoggedIn": true,
    "user": {
        "id": 5,
        "username": "test12456",
        "iat": 1697498317,
        "exp": 1697501917
    }
}

```json
{
    "isLoggedIn": false
}
```
